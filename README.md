# 🏦 Consumer Loan Underwriting & Default Prediction System

A production-ready dual-dashboard system for consumer loan risk assessment, combining **Machine Learning** with **IFRS 9 rules** for transparent, regulator-friendly credit decisions.

## 🚀 Live Demos

| Dashboard | Purpose | Link |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **Dashboard A** | New Loan Underwriting | [View Demo]([https://your-dashboard-a.onrender.com](https://mortgage-default-prediction-system.onrender.com/)) |
| **Dashboard B** | Existing Loan Monitoring | [View Demo]([https://your-dashboard-b.onrender.com](https://mortgage-default-prediction-system-1.onrender.com/)) |

The project includes two dashboards:

### Dashboard A: New Loan Underwriting
*Main underwriting interface with risk assessment and amortization schedule*

### Dashboard B: Existing Loan Monitoring
The system follows **Central Bank of Ireland (CBI)** lending guidelines and demonstrates real-world credit risk modelling.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### Dashboard A: New Loan Underwriting
- Predict default probability using XGBoost
- Grade recommendation (A–G)
- CBI compliance checks (LTI, stress test)
- Loan amortization schedule 
- SHAP-based risk explanation
- Optional LTV (collateral) analysis
- Supports multiple repayment types

### Dashboard B: Existing Loan Monitoring
- ✅ Hybrid AI (70% Rules / 30% ML for good borrowers)
- ✅ Full IFRS 9 staging (Stages 1, 2, 3)
- ✅ Dynamic delinquency adjustment (30/60/90+ DPD)
- ✅ Payment performance tracking (ahead/behind schedule)
- ✅ Collateral coverage & LGD adjustment
- ✅ Portfolio batch upload via CSV

## 🧠 Model Performance

| Model | AUC | Note |
|-------|-----|------|
| New Loan Model | 0.666 | Based on application data |
| Existing Loan Model | 0.9868 | Synthetic data; real-world would be 0.65-0.80 |

> ⚠️ Models trained on synthetically generated data (CTGAN) for demonstration.

---

## 🏛️ Regulatory Compliance

- **CBI Guidelines**: LTI ≤ 4.0x, stress test +2% with 35% cap
- **IFRS 9**: 3-stage ECL model (12-month → Lifetime → Write-off)
- **Transparent**: Rule-based overrides ensure ML never violates financial logic
